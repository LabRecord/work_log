# Introduction的重要性 (Why An Introduction Is Needed)

Introduction引言部分通过呈现研究课题所折射的研究理论来说服目标读者。引言部分不同于摘要（Abstract）,字数上没有严格的局限性，但是内容方面要求在对应的选题上更加精准和明确（be concise and to the point）。引言通常需要承接摘要部分提出的几个学术方向展开话题，从比较宽泛的学术背景铺垫逐渐过渡到论文的研究课题（narrow down to the research problem）。



Introduction的基本构成 (Major Components Of Introduction)
学术论文的引言部分主要包含以下几个方面的内容，我们一一展开详解：

研究背景和重要性（Background And Importance）

Mention of previous work on the subject
A statement of the importance of the subject
引言部分的第一段需要给出研究领域的大背景及其重要性所在。这个大背景勾勒出该领域科研成果从古至今的一个走向或者趋势 (what is known)，为接下来本论文课题的发展生长提供温床。这部分内容的展开一定要引用该领域前人、大牛的经典文献或者奠基性著作，体现你对于该学科的一个总体把握是全面且客观的。那如何从这个大背景引入到论文的课题呢？当我们从该学术领域的大趋势逐渐缩小范围时，只需把其中关联该论文课题的相关信息（keep stick to relevant information only）拎出来说，这样才能保证最后能自然过渡到文章将要探讨的科研课题。



引出该领域科研空白（What Is Unknown）

Description of knowledge gap
摆出该研究领域的一个概况之后，就要顺理成章地指出哪些是我们还未涉及的领域（或是没有研究透彻的问题）。当然这样的问题有千千万万，此处不能全部罗列，必要要对应着你的论文课题来谈。直白地说，就是你论文课题研究的什么，此处就针对性地写“这个课题尚未被太多科研者涉足”云云。



点题—指出本文的研究课题（Topic Of Research Paper）

Announce the research topic/question being addressed in research paper
How it will fill the missing brick in the wall of research already done
既然研究空白已近在眼前，那么对应的研究课题便要紧随其后。接下来就是你理直气壮陈述该论文主题的时刻，此时需要注意与研究空白的呼应，即在摆出课题是什么的基础之上更近一层，简要分析这个课题是如何填补了科研空白的。例如本文采用的模型预测精度更高？或是考虑了某个影响因子（前人研究没有考虑但是该因子其实很重要）的作用？亦或是在不同的实验条件、实验地点得出了和其他科研论文不一样的结论？

千万不要觉得这个关系显而易见嘛，为什么还要多写一句废话？殊不知这种 “进一步”的关联性分析往往是中国学生最喜欢忽略的，很多内容大家心里已经想到，唯独没有用英文去表述出来。



概述文章的核心方法论和主要发现（Highlight The Approach And Principal Findings）

Description of your approach and why you chose it (if needed)
Brief summary of your major findings
这部分的内容并不是每一个学科领域或者所有期刊都有要求，但如果你的文章依照学科惯例要对这两方面提及的话，则可在Introduction的中简洁地做出概述。需要注意一定要提出主要的研究手段(是什么以及为什么选择它)和研究发现，不要过分展开更不需谈及细节，精炼地点到为止即可。



提出猜想和研究目的（Hypothesis And Objectives）

最后在引言的结尾提出对之前科研问题的猜想以及你通过这项科研课题的研究想要达到的研究目的（Objectives）。研究目的可以依照文章的具体内容板块拆分成几个小点罗列出来。这种方式有点类似“节目预告”，给读者阅读后面的内容引路，一方面能够让读者明白后面内容的大致轮廓(Organization of this paper)，另一方面也能抓住读者的注意力继续循着你提供的线索和方向探究下去。



Introduction写作常见误区
误区1.一个观点或者论据引用一大串文献 Give too many citations for one point

例如Many studies have found a significant association between X and Y [4-15]. 这句话引用文献 [4-15] 实在是太多了，堆砌在一个观点的后面是审稿人很反感的。尽量节选重要的经典的或者最近的文献来引用。如果说这些文献实在是都很值得引用，那么不妨尝试改用下面的句式来展现A significant association has been found between X and Y in men
[4-7], women [8-11], and children [12-15].



误区2.指出研究课题不具体说明到底如何有研究价值 Explain why your research topic is worth of study

例如我在修改学生论文时最常遇到的表达就是“… is important…”,但是没有给出细节描述重要性体现在哪些方面。所以如果你想说The development of new materials is important for the automotive industry, 则应该要这样去表述The development of new materials is necessary for the automotive industry to produce stronger, lighter vehicles, which will improve safety and fuel economy.（推荐表达，加粗部分具体指明在哪几个点体现新材料的重要性）



误区3.细节过多导致句子不够精炼 Bury your readers in detail

引言部分不要摆太多的细节和具体数据，尤其是关于论文研究结果的具体数据。关于研究方法、研究结果只需要概述性地在引言部分点到为止即可，接下来的章节会给它们更多的空间去展开更具体的内容。如果说引言部分所有论据和陈述都罗列太多细节性的内容，会让句子显得非常臃肿，导致干扰信息过多让读者抓不住重点。

例如 a previous study conducted in 2014 found that 10% fewer individuals were diagnosed with age-related diseases, such as arthritis, in areas with such healthcare policies in place.

推荐修改如下更精炼简洁 a previous study found that fewer individuals were diagnosed with age-related diseases in areas with such healthcare policies.
